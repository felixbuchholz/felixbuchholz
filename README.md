### Hey! ðŸ‘‹ 

Looking forward to getting to know you and hopefully working together!

_In a project I care more about the people Iâ€™m working with and the work itself rather than about my role._

I work as ...  
> :art: an artist,  
:mag: a designer,  
:computer: a developer,  
:busts_in_silhouette: a collaborator and    
:tada: motivator.



Iâ€™m always interested in new ways to collaborate so donâ€™t hesitate to [contact me](mailto:felix@felixbuchholz.com)!

### Topics Iâ€™ve worked on:

- Material Inequality and (innovative) ideas to alleviate it
- Transparency in finance and how to improve it
- Mass incarceration in the U.S. and criminal justice reform
- Fair pay for artists
- Refugee Rights in Europe
- Gentrification in Belgrade

Iâ€™m always excited to work on similarly minded projects.
